# cc-table
Collection of Chinese-Character related tables

Each collection should be put into its own sub-folder/project, in order to be referenced separately, so as not to pull-in more than necessary when importing with Go `import`. 

The "Naming Convention" of Go projects in sub-folders [goes here](https://github.com/go-cc/cc-table/wiki/Naming-Convention).
